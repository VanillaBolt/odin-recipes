    <h2>Decription</h2>
    <p> Making saucy, perfectly seasoned baked brisket is a breeze. You'll find the full recipe below with step-by-step
        instructions, but here's what you can expect when you make this top-rated recipe:
        Start by generously seasoning both sides of the brisket, then refrigerate uncovered for 8-12 hours. Next, saute
        the onions over medium heat before adding the garlic, rosemary, and apple juice. Boil the mixture until the
        volume is reduced by half.
        Add the apple-onion mixture and brisket to a baking dish and cook at 325 degrees F for about 90 minutes. Reduce
        the heat, continue cooking for another 2 hours, and transfer the brisket to a foil-tented plate. Make a gravy
        with the braising liquid and serve with the sliced beef. </p>

    <ul>
        <li>3 pounds first-cut brisket (or flat-cut), trimmed of fat</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li> 4 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Â½ teaspoon cayenne pepp</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 large yellow onion, sliced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, sliced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh rosemary</li>
        <li>1 cup apple juice</li>
    </ul>


    <ol>
        <li>Season both sides of the brisket generously with salt, pepper, and cayenne.
            For best results, place brisket over an aluminum foil "rack" set over a plate and refrigerate,
            uncovered, 8 to 12 hours. </li>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and salt. Cook and stir until translucent, about 5
            minutes.
        <li>Stir in garlic, rosemary, and apple juice. Increase heat to high and boil until liquid is reduced by
            about
            half,
            about 3 minutes. </li>
        </li>
        <li>Transfer half of the apple-onion mixture into a baking dish.
            Place brisket fat-side up on top; cover with remaining apple-onion mixture.
            Cover baking dish tightly with foil. </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour 30 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 250 degrees F (121 degrees C)
            and bake until fork-tender, about 2 hours 15 minutes.
            Check for doneness after 2 hours. </li>
        <li>
            Transfer brisket to a plate and tent with foil.
        </li>
        <li>Pour the onions and braising liquid into a large measuring cup or bowl. Skim some fat off the top.
            Puree with a stick blender to create a gravy. </li>
        <li>Slice brisket across the grain and serve with the gravy. </li>
    </ol>
